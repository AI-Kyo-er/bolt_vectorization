BOLT Demo 1 - Compute Heavy Benchmark Results
=============================================

Test Program: compute_heavy.c
- Hot function: 1,000,000 calls
- Medium function: 100,000 calls  
- Cold function: 1,000 calls

Original Program Performance (5 runs):
- 0.214197 seconds
- 0.218075 seconds
- 0.210947 seconds
- 0.209637 seconds
- 0.210673 seconds
Average: 0.21271 seconds

BOLT Optimized Program Performance (5 runs):
- 0.203758 seconds
- 0.223147 seconds
- 0.218735 seconds
- 0.202419 seconds
- 0.204713 seconds
Average: 0.21055 seconds

Performance Improvement: 
- Time reduction: 0.00216 seconds
- Speedup: 1.01% (minimal improvement)

Analysis:
- BOLT achieved basic code layout optimization
- Limited improvement due to lack of runtime profile data
- The program's compute-intensive nature limits memory/cache optimization benefits
- Better results would be expected with proper perf profile integration
