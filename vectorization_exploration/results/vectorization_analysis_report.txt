=====================================

This report analyzes vectorization patterns in different loop scenarios and identifies
opportunities for binary/IR level optimization when vectorization is suboptimal.

COMPILER VECTORIZATION RESULTS:
===============================

Successfully Vectorized Loops (10 instances):
- Line 11: simple_vectorizable_loop - 16 byte vectors
- Line 18: loop_with_function_call - 16 byte vectors  
- Line 29: non_contiguous_access - 16 byte vectors
- Line 44: mixed_data_types - 16 byte vectors
- Line 65: matrix_multiply_naive (inner loop) - 16 byte vectors
- Line 75: reduction_loop - 16 byte vectors

- Line 97: pointer_arithmetic_loop - 16 byte vectors
- Line 116: main() initialization loop - 16 byte vectors
- Line 191: matrix initialization loop - 16 byte vectors

Failed Vectorization Patterns:
=============================

1. Data Type Issues:
   - "unsupported data-type" - Multiple instances
   - "no vectype for stmt" - Float operations

2. Dependence Issues:
   - "possible dependence between data-refs" - Read-after-write dependencies
   - "would need a runtime alias check" - Pointer aliasing

3. Control Flow Issues:
   - "control flow in loop" - Conditional statements
   - "complicated access pattern" - Irregular memory access

4. Structural Issues:
   - "multiple nested loops" - Complex loop structures
   - "data ref analysis failed" - Complex pointer arithmetic

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
====================

Test Case Performance (normalized per iteration):
1. Simple vectorizable loop: 0.000233 seconds
2. Loop with function call: 0.000562 seconds (2.4x slower)
3. Non-contiguous access: 0.000215 seconds (0.9x)
4. Loop with dependencies: 0.000318 seconds (1.4x slower)
5. Mixed data types: 0.000234 seconds (1.0x)
6. Irregular bounds: 0.000304 seconds (1.3x slower)
7. Matrix multiplication: 0.065128 seconds (280x slower)
8. Reduction loop: 0.000069 seconds (0.3x - fastest)
9. Conditional loop: 0.000219 seconds (0.9x)
10. Pointer arithmetic: 0.000206 seconds (0.9x)

KEY FINDINGS:
=============

1. Vectorization Success vs Performance:
   - Some loops were vectorized but still show poor performance
   - Matrix multiplication: vectorized inner loop but overall still slow
   - Function calls in loops: vectorized but 2.4x slower than simple loops

2. Suboptimal Vectorization Scenarios:
   - Mixed data types: vectorized but type conversion overhead
   - Non-contiguous access: vectorized but memory access pattern inefficient
   - Conditional loops: vectorized but branch prediction issues

3. Binary/IR Level Optimization Opportunities:
   - Data layout optimization for non-contiguous access
   - Loop restructuring for better vectorization
   - Memory alignment and padding
   - SIMD instruction selection optimization

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BINARY/IR LEVEL OPTIMIZATION:
================================================

1. Memory Layout Optimization:
   - Reorganize data structures for better cache locality
   - Implement structure-of-arrays (SoA) instead of array-of-structures (AoS)
   - Add padding for SIMD alignment

2. Loop Transformation:
   - Loop unrolling for better instruction-level parallelism
   - Loop interchange for better memory access patterns
   - Loop fusion to reduce loop overhead

3. SIMD Instruction Optimization:
   - Manual SIMD intrinsics for critical loops
   - Custom vectorization for complex patterns
   - Runtime vectorization for dynamic cases

4. Compiler Flag Optimization:
   - Experiment with different optimization levels
   - Use profile-guided optimization (PGO)
   - Try different vectorization strategies

CONCLUSION:
===========

The analysis reveals that while GCC's auto-vectorizer successfully vectorizes many loops,
there are significant opportunities for binary/IR level optimization to improve performance
beyond what the compiler can achieve automatically. The key areas for improvement are:

1. Memory access pattern optimization
2. Data structure layout improvements  
3. Manual SIMD optimization for complex cases
4. Runtime optimization based on data characteristics

This demonstrates the value of the second goal: detecting and optimizing vectorization
opportunities at the binary stream or higher IR level when compiler vectorization is
suboptimal.
